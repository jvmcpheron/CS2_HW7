# CS2_HW7

You will do this homework in teams of 3-4 students.  Try to pick students you have not worked with before.

## Introduction
In class and in the notes I showed you how to define the operations for a queue (empty(), push(v), pop(), and front()) for a circular array using pseudo-code.  

## What to Implement
Working with your team, write the code for such a queue (you can make the info for each node a string). You can implement the array yourself or use a vector.  If the queue ever becomes full, double the size of the array to solve the problem.  Finally, write some testing of your code to show it works.

## What to Submit
Submit your solution as a CPP file. Give the file the name AssignmentTypeNumberLastNameFirstName.cpp (so, for example, my submission for Homework 3 would be named Homework3MaclinRichard.cpp). You should also include your first and last name in the file as a comment and the names of your teammates.   Add a long comment in your code showing examples of your code correctly calculating the results.
